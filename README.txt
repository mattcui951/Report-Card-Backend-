Need courses.csv, marks.csv, tests.csv, students.csv are under the same directory as main.cpp

To run the program, simply use c++ compiler.
g++ main.cpp -o "executable file name you wanted"
./"executable file name you wanted"
Then an output.txt file should be created, open it to see all students report cards.

"Courses weights do not add up to 100" is handled
"A student do not complete all tests within a course" is handled

Used basic structure mainly map and vector to do the problem.

(P.S.  I wish I had chosen python, could have been so much easier.)
